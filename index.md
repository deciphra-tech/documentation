# üåü Welcome to Deciphra

**Deciphra** is a revolutionary obfuscation solution for **Lua**. Our goal is to make security available to everyone that needs it.

## üîí Access

Deciphra is **completely free** and we must take some precautions due to that. The access to our service is **semi-private**, this means that users of our Discord server can invite **2 people per month**. We do this to protect our service from potential attackers but also provide it without any costs. Also, all of Deciphra's source code is unavailable to the user to not expose our protection techniques to attackers.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Last Words

We sadly can't garuantee that your code will be **protected forever**. **Deciphra might be shut down at any time for any reason, and any protection might be bypassed at any time.** This is not because of Deciphra's characteristics, it is because no system is completely secure. We still hope to protect your code for as long as possible and make it extremely difficult to reverse engineer.
